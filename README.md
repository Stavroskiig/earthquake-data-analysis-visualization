# Earthquake Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing earthquake data from the Institute of Technical Seismology and Anti-Seismic Constructions (ITSAK) database. The data covers the period from 2013 to 2023 and is processed using Python and Pandas for insightful data analysis and visualization. The project also includes the creation of interactive maps using Folium to display earthquake locations and magnitudes.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pandas
- Folium
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stavroskiig/earthquake-data-analysis-visualization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
     python main.py
   ```

4. Explore the generated visualizations and maps in the output directory.

## Visualizations

* Bar graph showing the top 10 strongest earthquakes.
* Interactive map displaying earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.5.
